# Calculator 
## Purpose/Reasoning 
In my web development classes, the primary focus was HTML and CSS and learning to build static webpages. We did a couple of basic projects but nothing involving Javascript outside of a general gist of what it does. 
I have spent some time online with different tutorials messing around with Javascript but have never tried to do my own thing with it. But the only way to get better at it is to build something with it, so I chose a calculator. 

## Technologies:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

# Goals
- To create a working calculator with HTML, CSS, and Javascript
- To use this project to expand my knowledge and experience with Javascript
- To complete my first self-guided project, without following along with a tutorial or design guide
